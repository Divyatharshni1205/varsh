            <span class="year">Grade 2-5 | Where It All Began</span>
            <h2>Our Chocolate Adventures 🍫</h2>
            <p>
                Do you remember? Grade 2, when we first saw each other and our eyes met with that spark of instant friendship. 
                We were just little girls with big dreams and even bigger appetites for chocolates! Those sneaky detours on 
                the way to school, tiptoeing into shops, sharing secret looks as we grabbed our favorite chocolates... 
                We thought we were so clever, didn't we? 😄
            </p>
            <p>
                Those were the days of innocent giggles, shared lunches, whispered secrets during class, and dreams of what 
                we'd become when we grew up. Little did we know that the friendship we were building would become stronger 
                than anything we could have imagined.
            </p>
            <p>
                You were my partner in crime, my favorite person to laugh with, and the one who made school feel like home. 
                Those five years laid the foundation of something beautiful - a friendship that would survive everything life 
                threw at us. And look at you now - from that little chocolate-loving girl to this incredible 20-year-old woman! 💝

            <span class="year">Grade 6 Onwards | Different Schools, Same Heart</span>
            <h2>Distance Couldn't Break Us 💪</h2>
            <p>
                When we got into different schools after 5th grade, I remember the sadness we both felt. No more sitting 
                together in class, no more shared tiffins, no more walking home together. But you know what? Our hearts 
                refused to accept the distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                New schools, new friends, new experiences - but nothing, NOTHING could replace what we had. While others 
                drifted apart, we held on tighter. Late night calls, weekend meetups, updates about our new lives... we 
                made sure distance was just a number, not a barrier.
            </p>
            <p>
                This phase taught us something beautiful - true friendship doesn't need proximity. It needs commitment. 
                And we were both committed to never letting go. Through all those teenage years, we stayed true to us. ❤️

                College came with another crossroad - you chose medicine, I chose computer science. You decided to heal 
                people's bodies, I decided to solve digital problems. Two completely different paths, two completely 
                different worlds. But guess what never changed? Us. We never changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                While you were learning about the human heart, you were also teaching mine what true friendship means. 
                While I was learning to code, you were showing me how to decode life's challenges. We became each other's 
                biggest cheerleaders, celebrating every small victory and holding each other through every tough night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your late-night study sessions, my coding marathons - we understood each other's struggles even though 
                they were worlds apart. And now you're 20, ready to save lives and change the world! 🌟

                As you step into your 20s - this exciting new decade - I want to make a promise: No matter where life 
                takes us, we will ALWAYS make time for each other. Because some friendships aren't just for a season, 
                they're for a lifetime. And ours? Ours is forever. 💕

                shine even brighter, dream even bigger, and achieve everything your heart desires. And I'll be right here, 
                cheering you on every step of the way! 🎉
